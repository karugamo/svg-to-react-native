# svg-to-react-native

Just a small wrapper around https://react-svgr.com/ for converting SVGs to their
React Native SVG version through your clipboard.

## Usage
```
npx svg-to-react-native

Or install globally

svg-to-react-native

You will need an SVG in your clipboard and it will convert it into the React Native version.
